The default `.env` works for local development:
```env
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

---

## MongoDB Atlas Setup

1. Go to **https://cloud.mongodb.com** and sign up (free)
2. Create a new project → **Build a Cluster** → choose **M0 Free Tier**
3. Select region closest to you (e.g., Mumbai `ap-south-1`)
4. Under **Database Access** → Add database user:
   - Username: `educloud_user`
   - Password: generate a strong one
   - Role: **Atlas Admin**
5. Under **Network Access** → Add IP Address → **Allow from Anywhere** (`0.0.0.0/0`)
6. Go to **Clusters** → **Connect** → **Drivers** → copy the URI
7. Replace `<password>` with your password and paste into `MONGODB_URI`

---

## Running the Project

You need **two terminals** running at the same time.

### Terminal 1 — Backend

```bash
cd learning-platform/backend
npm run dev
```

Expected output:
```
✅ MongoDB connected
🚀 Server running on port 5000
```

### Terminal 2 — Frontend

```bash
cd learning-platform/frontend
npm start
```

The app opens automatically at **http://localhost:3000**

### Seed Demo Data (Run Once)

```bash
cd backend
node utils/seed.js
```

This creates demo accounts and sample courses in your database.

## AI Features — HuggingFace Setup

### Step 1 — Create Account

1. Go to **https://huggingface.co** → Sign Up (free)
2. Verify your email

### Step 2 — Get API Token

1. Click your profile → **Settings** → **Access Tokens**
2. Click **New token** → Name it `educloud` → Role: **Read**
3. Click **Generate** → **Copy the token immediately** (shown only once)

Token format: `hf_abcDEFghiJKLmnoPQRstuvWXYZ123456`

### Step 3 — Add to .env

```env
HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_your_actual_token_here
```

### Step 4 — Restart Backend

```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop, then:
npm run dev
```

### Step 5 — Verify

Open: `http://localhost:5000/api/ai/status`

```json
{ "success": true, "aiAvailable": true, "model": "HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta" }
```

### Models Used

| Task | Model | Notes |
|------|-------|-------|
| Chat + Quiz | `HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta` | Free, no gating, works immediately |
| Summarization | `facebook/bart-large-cnn` | Purpose-built, always available |
| Fallback | `tiiuae/falcon-7b-instruct` | Open access backup |

> **Why not Mistral?** Mistral-7B requires accepting a gating agreement on HuggingFace even with a valid token. Zephyr-7B is fully open, performs similarly, and works immediately with just a token.

### First-Time Cold Start

HuggingFace loads models on demand. The **first request after a long idle period** may take 20–40 seconds while the model loads. This is normal — subsequent requests respond in 2–8 seconds. The app automatically waits and retries.

### Demo Mode (No API Key)

Without an API key, all AI features still work in **demo mode** — the chatbot returns helpful pre-written answers, and the quiz generator returns sample questions. The UI shows "Demo Mode" status.

---

## Email Notifications Setup

Emails are sent for:
- **Account created** — login credentials (email + password + employee ID) sent to new user
- **Course enrolled** — student notified when admin/teacher enrolls them
- **Assignment graded** — student gets their grade and feedback by email

### Gmail Setup (Recommended)

1. Use a Gmail account as your sender
2. Enable 2-Step Verification: **Google Account → Security → 2-Step Verification**
3. Generate App Password: **Security → App Passwords → Select app: Mail → Generate**
4. Copy the 16-character code (e.g., `abcd efgh ijkl mnop`)

```env
EMAIL_SERVICE=gmail
EMAIL_USER=your_gmail@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=abcd efgh ijkl mnop
```

> If `EMAIL_USER` or `EMAIL_PASS` are not set, the system logs emails to the console instead of sending them — this allows development without email setup.

---

## Deployment

### Backend — Railway (Easiest Free Option)

1. Push to GitHub
2. Go to **railway.app** → New Project → Deploy from GitHub
3. Select the `backend` folder as root
4. Add all environment variables from `.env`
5. Railway provides a URL like `https://your-app.railway.app`

### Backend — Render (Alternative Free)

1. Go to **render.com** → New Web Service
2. Connect your GitHub repo
3. Root Directory: `backend`
4. Build Command: `npm install`
5. Start Command: `npm start`
6. Add environment variables in dashboard

### Frontend — Vercel (Recommended)

1. Go to **vercel.com** → New Project → Import GitHub repo
2. Set Root Directory to `frontend`
3. Add environment variables:
   ```
   REACT_APP_API_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app/api
   REACT_APP_SOCKET_URL=https://your-backend.railway.app
   ```
4. Deploy — Vercel gives a free `.vercel.app` domain

### Database — MongoDB Atlas (Already Free)

Your Atlas cluster is already in the cloud. Just update `MONGODB_URI` in production environment variables.

### AWS S3 — File Storage (Optional)

For production file uploads instead of local storage:

1. Create an S3 bucket in AWS Console
2. Set bucket policy to allow public reads
3. Create IAM user with S3 access, copy keys
4. Add to production environment:
   ```env
   AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_key
   AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret
   AWS_REGION=ap-south-1
   AWS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
   ```

The app automatically uses S3 when these are set, local disk otherwise.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start

```
Error: Cannot find module 'xyz'
```
Run `npm install` inside the `backend` folder.

---

### MongoDB connection error

```
MongoServerError: bad auth
```
- Check username and password in `MONGODB_URI`
- Make sure your IP is whitelisted in Atlas Network Access (`0.0.0.0/0` for dev)
- The database name in the URI should be `learning_platform`

---

### AI showing "Demo Mode" even after adding key

1. Token must start with `hf_`
2. No quotes around the value in `.env`:
   ```env
   # Correct
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY=hf_abc123
   
   # Wrong
   HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY="hf_abc123"
   ```
3. Restart the backend server after editing `.env`
4. Test: `http://localhost:5000/api/ai/status` should return `"aiAvailable": true`

---

### Admin analytics shows 0s or 500 error

This happens if old course documents have `enrolledStudents` as null. The analytics route uses `$ifNull` to handle this. If you still see 0s:

```bash
# Reseed the database
cd backend
node utils/seed.js
```

---

### Assignments returning 404

Make sure `server.js` has this line:
```js
app.use('/api/assignments', require('./routes/assignments'));
```

---

### Emails not sending

If `EMAIL_USER` and `EMAIL_PASS` are not set, emails are logged to console — this is not an error. To enable:
1. Use Gmail with 2-Step Verification enabled
2. Create an App Password (not your regular Gmail password)
3. Use the 16-character App Password as `EMAIL_PASS`

---

### Port 5000 or 3000 already in use

```bash
# Kill the process on port 5000
npx kill-port 5000

# Kill the process on port 3000
npx kill-port 3000
```

---

### React app shows blank white screen

Open browser DevTools (F12) → Console tab and check for errors. Common causes:
- Backend is not running — start it with `npm run dev` in the `backend` folder
- Wrong `REACT_APP_API_URL` in frontend `.env`
- Missing `npm install` in the `frontend` folder

---

## Security Notes (Production)

- Change `JWT_SECRET` to a 64-character random string
- Set `NODE_ENV=production`
- Use HTTPS (SSL certificate via Let's Encrypt or AWS ACM)
- Remove `0.0.0.0/0` from MongoDB Atlas, whitelist only your server IPs
- Never commit `.env` files to version control (already in `.gitignore`)
- Rotate `HUGGINGFACE_API_KEY` every 3–6 months

---
